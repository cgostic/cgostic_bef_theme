If you have ever wondered the answer to the rhetorical question "what are the odds?!", the Poisson family of distributions might just be for you. For example, picture yourself in Yankee stadium. The opposing team has just hit its 12th home run of the game, and the angry New Yorker behind you shouts, "Geez! What are the odds?! Fuggedduhboudit!" By quickly Googling the average number of home runs hit per game, you can use the Poisson distribution to turn and tell him just exactly what the odds are.

#### **When does the Poisson distribution apply?**

The Poisson distribution allows you to calculate the probability that an event occurs a certain number of times given an expected rate. If we know that 4 commercials typically air per hour of television, we can figure out the probability that 2 will play in an hour.

The Poisson distribution can be applied under the following conditions<sup>1 2 3</sup> :

1. The number of occurrences can be counted by positive, whole numbers (i.e. An event that can occur 1.5 times shold not be modeled by the Poisson distribution)
2. Events are independent
3. At a single point in time, an event either occurs or it does not
4. You know the average rate of occurrences over a given period, and the rate doesn't change over that period

The Poisson distribution holds meaning only for events that _have_ occurred. In other words, it can provide no help if you are interested in how many times something _has not_ occurred. 

#### **Properties**
Unlike most other distribution families, the Poisson distribution is influenced by only one parameter, λ. λ represents the mean rate of occurrence over a given period. Some valid values of λ could be 70 steps per minute, 200 packages shipped per day, or 20 whistles per soccer game.

The Poisson formula<sup>1</sup> is--

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24%24P%28k%29%20%3D%20e%5E%7B-%5Clambda%7D%5Cfrac%7B%5Clambda%5Ek%7D%7Bk%21%7D%24%24)

--where $P$ is the calculated probability that $k$ events occur over a time period, given λ. If we plot<sup>5</sup> $P(k)$ for $\lambda = 1$, we see a distribution with a peak at our λ value of k=1:

#### P(k), λ = 1

This makes sense intuitively, since we expect the event to occur λ times more than any other value of k. 

#### **Variance**
How would we expect the Poisson Distribution to change for different λ values?

To find out, let's plot<sup>5</sup> the Poisson Distribution for λ =3:

#### P(k), λ = 3
![alt text](https://github.com/cgostic/cgostic_bef_theme/blob/master/lambda3.png)

Here's λ = 6 as well:

#### P(k), λ = 6
![alt text](https://github.com/cgostic/cgostic_bef_theme/blob/master/lambda6.png)

The Poisson Distribution flattens and spreads with increasing λ, much like your chocolate chip cookies would if you added more and more butter to the dough. 

To explain this behavior, we should consider the variance formula<sup>1</sup> for a Poisson distribution:


### Var = λ


The mean and variance of a Poisson distribution have a one-to-one relationship, so for distributions with higher means, the probability of seeing events further from the mean is higher than for distributions with lower means. This makes sense if you consider concrete examples; It would not be surprising for grocery store that serves an average of 100 customers an hour to see either 85 or 115 during a given hour. However, a mechanic that typically fixes 5 cars per day would be shocked if 20 cars pulled up to her shop throughout the day. Each of the above examples considers values 15 away from the mean, but for distributions with low lambdas, most of the probability mass is clustered close to the mean. For distributions with high lambdas, the probability is spread more equally among a larger range of values.

In the animation<sup>4</sup> below, you can see the distribution flattening and widening as λ, and respective $variance$, increases.

#### **Let's do an example!**
Now, that we have discussed the shape and behavior of the Poisson Distribution, let's put some numbers to it: 

**_Each second, an average of 3 babies are born into the world. What is the probabilty that 5 babies are born in any given second?_**


>First, we should check that this question can be solved using the Poisson Equation.
>- [x] The number of occurrences can be counted by positive, whole numbers-- <b>Babies cannot be born in fractions</b>
>- [x] Events are independent-- <b>One mother having a baby will not induce labor in another mother</b>
>- [x] At a single point in time, an event either occurs or it does not--<b>At any moment, a baby is born _or_ no baby is born</b>
>- [x] You know the average rate of occurrences over a given period-- <b>3 babies born per second</b>
>
>Next, we can define our parameter:
>
>##### λ = 3 
>
>And occurrence value of interest:
>
>##### k = 5
>
>Finally, let's calculate the probability using the Poisson formula:
>
>![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%24P%285%29%20%3D%20e%5E%7B-3%7D%5Cfrac%7B3%5E%7B5%7D%7D%7B5%21%7D%20%3D%200.10%24)
>
>Given an average rate of 3 babies born per second, there's a probability of **10%** that as many as 5 babies will be born in any given second.

The Poisson distribution plays an important role in Data Science projects because it allows us to plausibly simulate events even if all we know is the average rate of occurrence. The Poisson distribution has widespread application in our lives, and likely even within your daily routine. Now that it is top-of-mind, you might start to notice these situaitons and recognize the true power of Poisson.
